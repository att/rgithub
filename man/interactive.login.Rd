\description{
interactive.login opens a web browser, asks for your username+password,
performs the OAuth dance, retrieves the token, and uses it to create a github
context.
}
\details{
If you use rgithub interactively, then you will get a default
client ID and client secret that you can use. Please don't abuse that,
or the feature might need to be removed.
